## ðŸš€ About Me

I am currently retraining to become a front-end developer and am taking the Application Developer - JavaScript React course at OpenClassrooms.

The objective of this training is to acquire a specialization in front-end and to consolidate the knowledge that I obtained during my previous training in web development.

The ultimate goal is to find a first position as a junior web developer to perfect my skills and gain more experience.

I am a professional with many years of experience in controlling and accounting, combined with a solid higher education background. I am able to function independently, and I have a strong sense of organisation and proven analytical and synthesis skills.

I am empathetic and rigorous by nature, I listen to others and I can easily work in a team.
